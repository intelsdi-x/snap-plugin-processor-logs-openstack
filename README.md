# Snap plugin processor - logs-openstack

Snap plugin intended to process openstack logs collected by [snap-plugin-collector-logs](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-logs).

## Getting Started
### System Requirements 
* [golang 1.7+](https://golang.org/dl/) (needed only for building)

### Operating systems
All OSs currently supported by snap:
* Linux/amd64

### Installation
#### Download logs-openstack plugin binary:
You can get the pre-built binaries for your OS and architecture from the plugin's [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-processor-logs-openstack/releases) page.
Download the plugin from the latest release and load it into `snapteld` (`/opt/snap/plugins` is the default location for Snap packages).

#### To build the plugin binary:
Fork https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-processor-logs-openstack

Clone repo into `$GOPATH/src/github/intelsdi-x/`:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/<yourGithubID>/snap-plugin-processor-logs-openstack
```
Build the plugin by running make in repo:
```
$ make
```
This builds the plugin in `./build`

### Configuration and Usage
* Set up the [Snap framework](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap#getting-started)

## Documentation

### Openstack Log Pattern

The Openstack log is expected to be in this form:
```
    <timestamp> <pid> <severity_label> <python_module> <payload>
```
Example:
```
    2016-12-07 03:53:55.873 24 INFO nova.osapi_compute.wsgi.server _some_message_
```

Find out more about Openstack logs pattern in [LOG_PATTERNS.md](LOG_PATTERNS.md)

### Openstack Log Processing

The intention of this plugin is parsing Openstack logs provided by [snap-plugin-collector-logs](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-logs) as metric's data
to process them to producing these values:
- `timestamp` which replaces metric's timestamp  
- `pid`  
- `severity_label` and `severity` where:  
  - "EMERGENCY" -> 0  
  - "ALERT"     -> 1  
  - "CRITICAL"  -> 2  
  - "ERROR"     -> 3  
  - "WARNING"   -> 4  
  - "NOTICE"    -> 5  
  - "INFO"      -> 6  
  - "DEBUG"     -> 7  
- `python_module`   
- `payload` which replaces metric's data  
- others request-context related (if occur in `payload`):  
  - `request_id`  
  - `tenant_id`  
  - `user_id`  
  - `http_method`  
  - `http_url`  
  - `http_version`  
  - `http_status`  
  - `http_response_size`  
  - `http_response_time`  
  - `http_client_ip_address`  
- and `logger` in form "openstack.\<service_name\>", where the `service_name` is determined in incoming metric's namespace as a _log_file_ (see [snap-plugin-collector-logs#collected-metrics](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-logs/blob/master/README.md#collected-metrics)).
     

#### How it works
 
For example, for the following metric which is input provided by [snap-plugin-collector-logs](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-logs):  

**Before processing**:
- Namespace: 	`/intel/logs/openstack/nova-api.log/metrics`
- Timestamp:    `2016-12-07T10:23:13.509335257+1:00`,
- Data:		     
 `"2016-12-07 03:53:55.873 24 INFO nova.osapi_compute.wsgi.server [req-0c0b761c-47b0-4bf5-832c-89ef048fa56a fa2b2986c200431b8119035d4a47d420 b1ad1df9062a4fc682904c6c9b0f4e98 - default default] 10.91.126.38,10.0.0.1 \"GET /v2.1/b1ad1df9062a4fc682904c6c9b0f4e98/extensions HTTP/1.1\" status: 200 len: 23011 time: 0.4711170"`

### Examples

This is an example running snap-plugin-collector-logs, processing collected openstack-logs and writing post-processed data to a file. It is assumed that you are using the latest Snap binary and plugins.
The example is run from a directory which includes snaptel, snapteld, along with the plugins and task file.

In one terminal window, open the Snap daemon (in this case with logging set to 1 and trust disabled) with appropriate configuration needed by logs collector. 
To do that properly, please follow the instruction on [snap-plugin-collector-logs](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-logs).
```
$ snapteld -l 1 -t 0 --config config.json
```
In another terminal window:

Download logs collector plugin:
```
$ wget http://snap.ci.snap-telemetry.io/plugins/snap-plugin-collector-logs/latest/linux/x86_64/snap-plugin-collector-logs
```

Load logs collector plugin:
```
$ snaptel plugin load snap-plugin-collector-logs
Plugin loaded
Name: logs
Version: 1
Type: collector
Signed: false
Loaded Time: Wed, 04 Jan 2017 15:06:30 CET
```
See available metrics for your system
```
$ snaptel metric list
```
Create a task manifest - see examplary task manifest in [examples/tasks](examples/tasks/):
```json

              "config": {
                "file": "/tmp/published_openstack_logs.log"
              }
